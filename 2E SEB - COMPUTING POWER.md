### AIM  
To write a Python program which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Start

2.Declare three integer variables: a, b, c

3.Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a

4.Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in b

5.Prompt the user to enter the third number and store it in c

6.Calculate the sum of the three numbers: s = a + b + c

7.Display the result s

8.End
